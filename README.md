# Predicting Home Values

## <div align="center">Project Overview</div>
Using a competition dataset from Kaggle with over 75 explanatory variables, I created a model that predicts the sale price of a house in Ames, Iowa based on its description. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to use an exploratory data analysis on a large, complicated dataset to produce a reliable predictive model.
