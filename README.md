# <div align="center">Predicting House Sale Price</div>

### <div align="center">Project Overview</div>
Using a competition dataset from Kaggle with 79 explanatory variables, I created a model that can predict the sale price of a house in Ames, Iowa. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to perform an exploratory data analysis on a large, complicated dataset and use the findings to produce a reliable predictive model. For a step-by-step guide through this analysis, please view the included Jupyter Notebook (House_Prices.ipynb).
