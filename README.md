# <div align="center">Predicting House Sale Price</div>

### <div align="center">Project Overview</div>
Using a competition dataset available on Kaggle, I created a model that can predict the sale price of a house in Ames, Iowa from 79 explanatory variables. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to tackle a complex dataset and model the behavior of a target variable. For a more in-depth look at this analysis, please refer to my [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/nphorsley59/House_Prices/blob/master/House_Prices.ipynb).
